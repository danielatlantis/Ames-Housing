# Boston-Housing

## Introduction

This dataset comes from a Kaggle competition that expands upon the famous Boston housing market dataset, which has 80 columns of predictors to analyze. I found the detail to the data very interesting and thought it could possibly make for more accurate predictions and provide good practice in dealing with data with large amounts of predictors but still perform data analysis.
